# Data Analysis Project
Polishing up on Python Programming Language, making use of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Library Practice

This folder is used to store all my Jupyter Notebooks used to learn the various Python libraries and any datasets that may be used for example work of data analysis. Currently, the folder consists of:

<ul>
    <li>numpy_start: Notebook on starting use of NumPy library</li>
    <li>pandas_start: Notebook on starting the use of Pandas library, creating and extracting datasets, cleaning, manipulating and creating presentable DataFrames & Series</li>
</ul>

## Bitcoin Mini Project

This is a mini project taken from DataCamp on how to use SQL, Python, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib in a real world example using a vast dataset about bitcoin value overtime.

In the project, I have learnt how to understand the different tasks given by a client on the specific information that they want to see and the appropriate commands needed to use as queries. 

I have learnt various commmands and what they do, on top of when to use them. From filtering out unnecessary rows, to creating unique visual plots to display information in a presentable fashion.
